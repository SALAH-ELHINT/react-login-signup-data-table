Welcome to my React JavaScript project! This project includes a login and signup feature, as well as a data table that displays all user information. It also incorporates the use of styled-components and Bootstrap for styling, with a cool button moving animation in the login form when the user and password fields are empty.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.
`npm install styled-components` to install styled-components.

## Features
- Login and Signup feature
- Data table displaying all user information
- Styled-components and Bootstrap for styling
- Cool button moving animation in the login form when the user and password fields are empty
- Data table implemented using react-table library, allowing for sorting, filtering, and pagination of data
- Responsive layout

## Usage

When the app loads, the user will be presented with a login and signup option. If the login credentials are correct, the user will be directed to a page that displays their name and a data table containing all user information. If the user chooses to sign up, they will be prompted to enter their information and will then be redirected to the login page.

The data table has been implemented using a popular library called react-table. It allows you to perform various operations on the data such as sorting, filtering and pagination. Styled-components have been used to create custom styles and animations, and Bootstrap has been used to provide a responsive layout.

The login form has a cool animation where the submit button moves when the user or password fields are empty, reminding the user to enter their credentials.
